										RAF SIMONS IN CONVERSATION WITH HANS ULRICH OBRIST

								<p class="title_wrapper">Hans Ulrich Obrist: I want to talk about the moment when you started to bring art into fashion through collaborations with artists. I think you designed your Tokyo store with Sterling Ruby in 2008. Was that the first artist collaboration where you brought an artist into the world of fashion?</p>
								<p class="text_wrapper">Raf Simons: Actually, parallel with that, and less known by the audience, are the two stores that shaped up in two Japanese cities. One was with Sterling, and the other one was with Roger Hiorns, an English artist. Unfortunately, both stores disappeared, and that’s the thing that I find so sad about fashion. Fashion is so connected to the business. You can be in a contract or a licensee, and then afterwards, things change. So everything changed, and both stores closed at one point when we had to stop our licensee. </p>
								<p class="text_wrapper">Before I graduated in Belgium, I was very interested in form, language, and conceptual approach, more than the technical aspects of industrial design. So I [eventually] graduated with furniture, and then I ended up doing a little bit of furniture design with a small gallery. I realized it wasn’t the right energy for me. At the same time, the Belgian fashion scene with Martin Margiela, Ann Demeulemeester, and Dries Van Noten was shaping up. After I graduated, I moved to Antwerp and connected with part of that scene. Not with Martin, because he already escaped to Paris, but with Walter Van Beirendonck and Dirk Van Saene and the younger people that were graduating at the Royal Academy. I was from the eastern part of Belgium, very disconnected from the Antwerp scene, so it was new for me. And once I moved, I was in the middle of that whole kind of environment. It was very energetic. Every evening, we would be together until the middle of the night, discussing fashion and art.</p>

						<p class="text_title">As Gilbert & George say, “To be with art is all we ask.” But then of course, after you invited artists to create a store, the next step of this integration was that you actually started to create a collection together with Sterling. How did that come about? </p>
						<p class="text_detail">Maybe these are two weird words to place here, but the art that I look at and the art that I collect makes me very happy and calm. Whereas the fashion world can be extremely restless, stressed, and nervous. As a creative animal, it gives me an enormous satisfaction, curiosity, and happiness to enter the world of an artist that I’m interested in. It’s going into their brain and seeing how they think. What is an artwork about? How does it connect to the world? How does it connect to people? </p>

							<p class="text_detail">My first encounter with Sterling’s work was just a simple piece. It was a very early ceramic. I saw the piece and I was like, “Who the fuck is that? Who made something like that?” So we met and started talking. His mom, who passed away, unfortunately, was Dutch, and lived very close to where I grew up, and it instantly created a connection. We just kept on talking over the years, and it became a very close friendship — I would almost say family. And it’s a very weird thing that I’m going to say now, because I really don’t want to make this sound pretentious, but sometimes I can think with some of the artists. Like, I’m so into their world that I can feel things. And when you build a friendship, you’re also open with each other. Like, I know that I can have a conversation with Sterling where I could say, “What if you would do it like that?” We can have that conversation. And it’s the other way around as well. </p>
							<p class="text_detail">At one point, we met each other in LA again and hung out. I don’t know if it was me saying it, or if it was him, but it was kind of this very mutual feeling, like, “Why don’t we do something together?” Then it was very much about, “Yeah, what should we do?” We already did the shop. So I said, “Well, let’s maybe do the collection together.” And he was like, “Yes.” It was that easy. </p>

							<p class="text_detail">Mapplethorpe was the most complicated one. With the natural collaborations, like Sterling, they came out of this kind of connection and friendship that was already there, and this mutual desire to do something together. I have to be honest with you here — I would never, ever contact the Mapplethorpe Foundation. Because I would just think that they would never be interested. I’m also not really thinking, like, “Who can be the next artist to contact to do something?” I don’t think like that. If it comes naturally, it comes naturally. But the Mapplethorpe Foundation reached out to me because [they are] very interested in investigating different formats to keep showing his work. They were very attracted by the idea of seeing the work in a very different physical situation. The only thing that I said to myself was: “If I do the collaboration, I really don’t want to change anything.” I wanted to frame it literally as they were framed. I want to bring them as frames, but on human beings. And they liked that idea, and that’s what we did. </p>
							<p class="text_detail">And Warhol?</p>
							<p class="text_detail">In the case of Andy Warhol, me coming as a European to America — at that time, with the political situation, I naturally felt like I wanted to do something with [his] disaster work. So we got in touch with the foundation. Obviously, I was also informed about how Andy himself so much desired for his work to keep on being commercially used after his death in order to support other art, and that’s a very beautiful thing. So it all kind of clicked very well, and that’s how it shaped up. </p>

						<p class="text_detail">I have a complicated relationship when it comes to fashion in a museum. I have to watch out what I’m saying here, because I think I’ll maybe take a too harsh position. I think there are incredible fashion exhibitions, however, one way or another, I always find it very complicated, because to me fashion is so connected to the physicality of a human being and characters. So it’s very complicated for me to answer this. I do think it over, because sometimes we are asked, and so far I have always refused. It’s also a very weird experience for me to realize where we are with the brand now. We’re becoming collectible, and it’s something I never really thought of, although I started to collect one designer in depth, and that’s Martin Margiela, because he — besides Helmut Lang — is the main reason why I wanted to be a fashion designer.</p>
						<p class="text_detail">At the time that Margiela was starting out, I was interning at Walter [Van Beirendonck]. I was brought to Paris, and we went to see two shows on the same day. One was Jean Paul Gaultier, which was the show where he introduced Junior Gaultier — with Neneh Cherry dancing on a chair and all that — which was mind-blowing. Jean Paul Gaultier’s shows at that time were what Dior shows are today. You know what I mean? They were these big spectacles.</p>

						<p class="text_title">In a way, it’s a form of legacy. And it’s interesting that labels are more and more becoming art institutions. You’ve outlined in a beautiful way in this conversation how you want to bring all these things together in this yet unrealized project of creating an institution. And your institution, I suppose, will be in Antwerp, correct?</p>
						<p class="text_detail">Not necessarily. I don’t know that yet. We have been looking for the past two years. But the one thing that I find interesting is that it’s a pilgrimage, a place where you have to go. The amount of visitors and all that kind of stuff isn’t important to me. For me, what’s important is that it’s going to still be there after I’m gone. As much as it’s fantastic, the whole fashion thing, it’s also partly frustrating. If I have to be really honest, I would prefer to be creative and not think, like, “Oh, that needs to sell, or that needs to be presented on that date.” I think it always comes back to the fact that I don’t only see myself as a fashion designer. It just doesn’t match. But, of course, to the world, I am.</p>
